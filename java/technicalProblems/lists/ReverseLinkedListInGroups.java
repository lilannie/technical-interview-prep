/**
 *
 Problem:
 Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function). If the linked list is given as 1→ 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7→ 8 → NULL and k = 3 then output will be 3 → 2 → 1 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 8 → 7 → NULL

 Input:
 Takes two arguments: the head of the linked list and int k. You should not read any input from stdin/console.
 The struct Node has a data part which stores the data and a next pointer which points to the next element of the linked list. There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

 Output:
 Reverse the linked list in the group of given size and return the reference of starting node (head) of the reversed Linked list.

 Example:
 Input:
 1
 8
 1 2 2 4 5 6 7 8
 4
 Output:
 4 2 2 1 8 7 6 5
